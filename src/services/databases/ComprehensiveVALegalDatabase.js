With chronic disease shown as such in service (or within the presumptive period under § 3.307) so as to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.

(c) Preservice disabilities noted in service.

(f) Post-traumatic stress disorder. Service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with § 4.125(a) of this chapter; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.`,

70% - Occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control; spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances; inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

50% - Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory; impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.

30% - Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss.

10% - Occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by continuous medication.

0% - A mental condition has been formally diagnosed, but symptoms are not severe enough either to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication.`,

        summary: 'Grant of service connection for PTSD based on combat stressor with lay evidence corroboration',
        fullText: `FINDINGS OF FACT:
1. The Veteran served in combat in Iraq from 2003 to 2004.
2. The Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD.
3. The Veteran's PTSD is related to his fear of hostile military activity while serving in Iraq.
4. The Veteran's stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW:
The criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304(f).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION:
The Veteran seeks service connection for PTSD. Service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.

The medical evidence shows a current diagnosis of PTSD that conforms to DSM-5 criteria. The Veteran served in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and his DD-214 confirms combat service. His claimed stressors of mortar attacks and IED explosions are consistent with the circumstances of his service. A VA examiner has linked the Veteran's PTSD to his combat experiences.

Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, service connection for PTSD is warranted.`,

1. The Veteran's lumbar spine disability is manifested by forward flexion limited to 25 degrees.
2. There is objective evidence of painful motion and functional loss due to pain.
3. The Veteran does not have unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.
4. There are no separately ratable neurological manifestations.

CONCLUSION OF LAW:
The criteria for a 40 percent rating, but no higher, for lumbar spine disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION:
Under Diagnostic Code 5242, a 40 percent rating is warranted when forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is limited to 30 degrees or less. VA examination shows forward flexion limited to 25 degrees with pain beginning at 20 degrees. Considering functional loss due to pain per DeLuca v. Brown, a 40 percent rating is appropriate.`,

1. The Veteran has the following service-connected disabilities: PTSD (50%), lumbar spine (20%), bilateral hearing loss (10%), and tinnitus (10%), for a combined rating of 70%.
2. The Veteran last worked full-time in 2019 as a warehouse supervisor.
3. Medical evidence indicates the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, particularly PTSD and back condition, preclude substantially gainful employment.
4. The Veteran has a high school education and work experience in manual labor.

CONCLUSION OF LAW:
The criteria for TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION:
TDIU may be assigned when a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due to service-connected disabilities. The Veteran meets the schedular criteria under 38 CFR 4.16(a) with a combined rating of 70% and one disability rated at 50%.

The evidence shows the Veteran's PTSD causes difficulty concentrating, irritability, and inability to tolerate workplace stress. His back condition prevents prolonged standing, sitting, or lifting. Vocational assessment indicates these limitations preclude all forms of employment consistent with his education and experience.`,
